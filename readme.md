## How to run this program (its very simple and concise)<br>
**Just type**
>`python RandomForest.py`

## All my source code and the datasets are in the '/datasets' folder.

in the terminal, **you should first navigate to '/datasets' folder (thats where my source code is)** and you will be able to run the model and create the its plots in one go. All the plots will also get saved in this very same folder. (Just make sure that when you try to run this file, you are in the '/datasets' folder). 

**Make sure to uncomment the `plt.savefig('figName.png')` (such lines) to also save the figure**

(If `python run.py` does not work, then try `python3 run.py`)

### *Thank you so much for taking out time for this, Have a beautiful day ahead :)*
