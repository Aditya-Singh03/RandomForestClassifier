## How to run this program (its very simple and concise)<br>
**Just type**
>`python run.py`

in the terminal and you will be able to run the model and create the its plots in one go. All the plots will also get saved in this very same folder. (Just make sure that when you try to run this file, you are in the same folder as the file's parent folder) Also, above every question, there exists a heading speciying the question number. 

(If `python run.py` does not work, then try `python3 run.py`)
